# Advanced HTML - Techium Project

## Description
This project focuses on structuring a complete web page for a company called **Techium** using advanced and semantic HTML5 tags. The goal was to build a solid skeleton for a website without using any CSS, ensuring accessibility and proper document hierarchy.

* Working with media elements: integrating images, videos, audio, and iframes.
* Structuring data using tables and lists.
* Ensuring W3C compliance.

## Project Structure
